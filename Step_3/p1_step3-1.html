    <p>Those days, I used to keep a list of all blogs in <strong>Persian</strong> and, for a while, I was the first person any new blogger in <strong>Iran</strong> would contact, so they could get on the list. That's why they called me "the blogfather" in my mid-twenties - it was a silly nickname, but at least it hinted at how much I cared.
    </p>
    <em>Every morning, from my</em> <h1>small</h1> apartment in downtown <strong>Toronto</strong>, I opened my computer and took care of the new blogs, helping them gain exposure and audience. It was a diverse crowd - from exiled authors and journalists, female diarists, and technology experts, to local journalists, politicians, clerics, and war veterans - and I always encouraged even more. I invited more religious, and pro-Islamic Republic men and women, people who lived inside <strong>Iran</strong>, to join and start writing.

    The breadth of what was available those days amazed us all. It was partly why I promoted blogging so seriously. I'd left <strong>Iran</strong> in late 2000 to experience living in the West, and was scared that I was missing all the rapidly emerging trends at home. But reading <strong>Iranian</strong> blogs in <strong>Toronto</strong> was the closest experience I could have to sitting in a shared taxi in <strong>Tehran</strong> and listening to collective conversations between the talkative driver and random passengers.

      There's a story in the Quran that I thought about a lot during my first eight months in solitary confinement. In it, a group of persecuted Christians find refuge in a cave. They, and a dog they have with them, fall into a deep sleep. They wake up under the impression that they've taken a nap: In fact, it's 300 years later. One version of the story tells of how one of them goes out to buy food - and I can only imagine how hungry they must've been after 300 years - and discovers that his money is obsolete now, a museum item. <em>That's when he realizes how long they have actually been absent.</em>
