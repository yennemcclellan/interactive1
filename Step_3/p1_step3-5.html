  <div id= "green"><p>Those days, I used to keep a list of all blogs in Persian and, for a while, I was the first person any new blogger in Iran would contact, so they could get on the list. That's why they called me "the blogfather" in my mid-twenties - it was a silly nickname, but at least it hinted at how much I cared.
  </p>
<p>  Every morning, from my apartment in downtown Toronto, I opened my computer and took care of the new blogs, helping them gain exposure and audience. It was a diverse crowd - from exiled authors and journalists, female diarists, and technology experts, to local journalists, politicians, clerics, and war veterans - and I always encouraged even more. I invited more religious, and pro-Islamic Republic men and women, people who lived inside Iran, to join and start writing.
</p>
</div>
  <div id= "black"><p>The breadth of what was available those days amazed us all. It was partly why I promoted blogging so seriously. I'd left Iran in late 2000 to experience living in the West, and was scared that I was missing all the rapidly emerging trends at home. But reading Iranian blogs in Toronto was the closest experience I could have to sitting in a shared taxi in Tehran and listening to collective conversations between the talkative driver and random passengers.
  </p>
  <p>  There's a story in the Quran that I thought about a lot during my first eight months in solitary confinement. In it, a group of persecuted Christians find refuge in a cave. They, and a dog they have with them, fall into a deep sleep. They wake up under the impression that they've taken a nap: In fact, it's 300 years later. One version of the story tells of how one of them goes out to buy food - and I can only imagine how hungry they must've been after 300 years - and discovers that his money is obsolete now, a museum item. That's when he realizes how long they have actually been absent.
