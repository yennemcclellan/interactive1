        <td><em>Those days, I used to keep a list of all blogs in Persian and, for a while, I was the first person any new blogger in Iran would contact, so they could get on the list. That's why they called me "the blogfather" in my mid-twenties - it was a silly nickname, but at least it hinted at how much I cared.
        </em></td>
        <td><em>Every morning, from my small apartment in downtown Toronto, I opened my computer and took care of the new blogs, helping them gain exposure and audience. It was a diverse crowd - from exiled authors and journalists, female diarists, and technology experts, to local journalists, politicians, clerics, and war veterans - and I always encouraged even more. I invited more religious, and pro-Islamic Republic men and women, people who lived inside Iran, to join and start writing.
