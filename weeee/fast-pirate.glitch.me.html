  Although the wind
  blows terribly here,
  the moonlight also leaks
  between the roof planks
  of this ruined house.

          Media types describe the general category of a given device. Although websites are commonly designed with screens in mind, you may want to create styles that target special devices such as printers or audio-based screenreaders. For example, this CSS targets printers:
        </p>
        <pre class="code">@media print { ... }</pre>
        <p>
          You can also target multiple devices. For instance, this @media rule uses two media queries to target both screen and print devices:
        </p>
        <pre class="code">@media screen, print { ... }</pre>
        <p>
          See Media types for a list of all media types. Because they describe devices in only very broad terms, just a few are available; to target more specific attributes, use media features instead.

        <strong>when the page is 700px make the font size appropriate</strong>
        <br><br>
        <strong>when printed make the font size and line width appropriate</strong>
        <br><br>
        <strong>when printed, how is each section delineated (is background still a good choice?)</strong>
